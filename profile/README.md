**Unleash started as a side project.** We wanted to fill an essential space in the development stack and control releases. At first, we were just a few contributors, but together we built a foundation for the amazing community that you see today. 🫂

We love that you — our community — have the freedom to work with our product in any way you want. Together we can test, experiment, and create a well-rounded product that covers a ton of different use cases. We're super proud of you 🙏

That's enough about us. Have fun. Be kind. Let's **Unleash** great software together. 💪
