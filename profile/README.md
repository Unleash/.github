**Unleash is the largest and fastest growing open source feature flag project in the world.** We exist to fill an essential space in the development stack and decouple code deployment from releasing features. At first, we were a side project, then just a few contributors, and now we are many. Together we have built an amazing product and community. 

We love that you — our community — have the freedom to work with our product in any way you want. Together we can test, experiment, and create a well-rounded product that covers a ton of different use cases. We're super proud of all we've done together 

That's enough about us. Have fun. Be kind. Let's **Unleash** great software together.
